# My First Blog
This repository is for my submission of the Module 4 Challenge. The application gives inputs for a user to enter the title, content and username of their blog posts. Upon submission, the blog post is posted onto a page titled blog post entries and the content of the posts is saved for future sessions. Users are able to submit new blog posts, which are posted below the previous submissions on the blog page.
